# Adrinth (Modrinth's Advertising)

Modrinth makes use of an in-house network called [Adrinth](https://adrinth.com). 90% of the ad revenue from all pages goes directly to creators. The remaining 10% of ad revenue pay for Modrinth's upkeep costs and allow us to continue to exist.

Adrinth ads are fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws, and fall under the [Acceptable Ads Standard](https://acceptableads.com/standard/). There is only ever one per page, they are less than 120 pixels tall, and they are separate and distinguishable from actual site content.

While you are not required to turn off your adblocker to access Modrinth, you would be supporting both Modrinth and its creators in the process. For the benefit of everyone involved, we humbly request that you turn off your adblocker. You can use the links on the right side to navigate to your browser or browser extension.

If none of the methods shown work or if you have more questions about Adrinth, please join us on [Discord](https://discord.modrinth.com) so that we can assist you!
