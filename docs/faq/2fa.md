# How can I make my Modrinth account more secure?

The best way to add more security to your Modrinth account is to set up [two-factor authentication (2FA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). Modrinth's 2FA setup uses [time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_one-time_password) that are accessible through Google Authenticator, Authy, Bitwarden, or any other application supporting TOTP 2FA. You can set this up under the "Account security" section of the [Modrinth account settings](https://modrinth.com/settings/account).
