# Why can't I launch the app on macOS Catalina (or older)?

If you are getting an error that says "Modrinth App cannot be opened because of a problem", your macOS version is not supported. The Modrinth App is unable to support macOS Catalina or older due to missing required libraries. If you are able to upgrade to macOS Big Sur or newer, please do so.
