# Can I run two copies of the same instance at the same time?

Due to restrictions with how Minecraft interacts with its files, it is not possible to run more than one copy of an instance at the same time. As a workaround, we suggest duplicating your instances. You can do this by right-clicking on the instance and clicking "Duplicate instance".
