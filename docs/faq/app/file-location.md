# Where are the Modrinth App files located?

The Modrinth App puts its files in a certain place depending on your operating system. These are the default values; you can change this directory in the "App directory" section of the launcher settings.

Please note: the Modrinth App **will break** if you change the app directory to any directory that requires administrator privileges, such as `Program Files` on Windows. Unless you really know what you're doing, we highly advise against changing the app directory.

## Windows

On Windows, files are stored in `%AppData%\com.modrinth.theseus\` by default.

To navigate to this directory, press <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> on your keyboard, then enter `%AppData%\com.modrinth.theseus\` into the dialog box.

## Mac

On Mac, files are stored in `~/Library/Application Support/com.modrinth.theseus/` by default.

To navigate to this directory, open Finder and click on "Go" in the bar at the top of your screen. In that menu, click "Go to folder", then enter `~/Library/Application Support/com.modrinth.theseus/` into the dialog box.

## Linux

On Linux, files are stored in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/com.modrinth.theseus/` (usually `~/.config/com.modrinth.theseus/`) by default.

As a Linux user, you're expected to know how to navigate to this directory yourself.
