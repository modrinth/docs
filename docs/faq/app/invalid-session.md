# Why can't I join multiplayer servers? (Invalid session)

If you are getting an error along the lines of "Invalid session", you must entirely close out of the Modrinth App and any other Minecraft instances you may have open. Then, open the game again. If the issue persists, [Minecraft's authentication servers may be down](https://downdetector.com/status/minecraft/). Modrinth cannot do anything about this; you must simply wait for them to work again.
