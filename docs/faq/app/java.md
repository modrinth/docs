# How do I install Java?

Java is the coding language that Minecraft uses. In order to play Minecraft, you must have Java installed.

Go to your app settings by clicking the cog (⚙️) in the bottom-left. Scroll down to "Java settings". Click "Install recommended" next to both "Java 17 location" and "Java 8 location". Allow some time for both to be downloaded.
