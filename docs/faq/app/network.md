# Why am I getting a network error when downloading files?

Any error along the lines of "end of file before message length reached" or "Error fetching URL" shows an issue with your network. If your Internet connection is limited, you should lower the "Maximum concurrent downloads" setting in the "Resource management" section of the app settings.
