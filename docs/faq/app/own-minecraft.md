# Why am I getting an error saying I don't own Minecraft, even though I do?

In order to play Minecraft, you need to have a Minecraft username set. In order to do this, log in to [Minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us). Then, go to the [Profile Name](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/mygames/editprofile) section. When prompted to set a username, do so here.

Once you have set a username, log into the Modrinth App. **Double-check to make sure you are using the same Microsoft account with the same email as the one you used to log in to Minecraft.net.** If it's trying to log you into a different email, click the "Sign in with a different Microsoft account" button near the bottom.

If you're sure you're logging in with the correct Microsoft account, there may be something with your configuration preventing the Modrinth App from communicating with Microsoft's servers. Try disabling any system-level or network-level ad blockers, or try setting up a VPN to a country with access to Microsoft services.
