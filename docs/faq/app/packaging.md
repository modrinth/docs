# Why isn't the Modrinth App packaged for my distribution?

For now, the only official distributions of the Modrinth App are via AppImage and Debian files. AppImage files can run on any distribution, so we generally recommend this method, even on Debian-based distributions. Community efforts are currently underway to create packages for Flatpak and Nix; otherwise, any distribution-specific packages are not official.
