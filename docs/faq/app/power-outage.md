# Why did my instances suddenly disappear?

Sometimes, closing out of the Modrinth App without properly shutting down your computer can cause your instances to disappear. For example, this commonly occurs following a power outage. Don't worry: your instance isn't lost! In order to recover an instance, follow these steps:

1. Create a new instance using the exact same loader and game version as the instance you wish to recover.
2. Open your file manager and find the folder that contains the instance you wish to recover. This will be somewhere in the `profiles` folder of the Modrinth App directory. If you're not sure where this is, check out [Where are the Modrinth App files located?](file-location.md)
3. Delete the `profile.json` file in the folder of the instance you wish to recover. Then, copy over all remaining files and folders to the new instance's folder.
4. Close out of any other instances you may have open and restart the app.
