# How do I repair an instance?

An instance can become corrupted for a variation of reasons. In most cases, such corruption can be fixed simply by repairing the instance. To repair an instance, go into the instance options, then scroll down to "Modpack" and repair as needed. Allow it some time to process, since this may take a while.
