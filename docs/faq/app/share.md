# How do I share a modpack with others?

Once you have [created an `.mrpack` file](modpack-basics.md), you can share this file with the world.

The main method of distribution is via the [Modrinth website](https://modrinth.com). First, log in to the website. Then, you can create a project by hovering over your avatar and clicking "Create a project". Make sure to select "Modpack" as the project type. Follow the checklist, ensuring you are following the rules and have [obtained permission to include each file](../../modpacks/permissions.md). Once submitted for review, you can expect it to be reviewed by our moderators [within 24-48 hours](../index.md#review-times).

Alternatively, if your pack is only for you and a few friends, you can share the `.mrpack` file using your file host of choice â€” [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), [OneDrive](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/onedrive/online-cloud-storage), [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com), etc. This method of distribution is much faster and does not involve intervention by Modrinth's moderators. However, it does not allow users to easily move between multiple versions of the same modpack.
