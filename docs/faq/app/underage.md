# Why am I getting an error saying my account is underage?

Microsoft only allows external launchers to play Minecraft if they are 18+ or if they are connected to a Family group. You can change your account age in [the Microsoft account settings](https://account.microsoft.com/profile) or be added to a Family group on the [Microsoft Family Safety](https://family.microsoft.com) page.
