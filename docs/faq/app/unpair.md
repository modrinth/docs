# How do I unlock or unpair an instance?

When you install a modpack from Modrinth, it is paired and locked to only contain the content from that modpack. By unlocking a modpack, you can add your own content. By unpairing a modpack, you remove the link between your local installation and the modpack as available on Modrinth.

To unpair and/or unlock an instance, go into the instance options, then scroll down to "Instance management" and unpair/unlock as needed.
