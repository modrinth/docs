# Why can't I launch certain Minecraft versions?

Due to technical restrictions, the Modrinth App does not currently support Forge installations on Minecraft versions 1.5 through 1.6.4. Additionally, on Windows only, 1.5.2 or older will not work, even with a Vanilla instance. This is a known issue, and we are working on fixing it.
