# Why doesn't the app boot? (Corrupted Microsoft Edge WebView2 installation)

The Modrinth App utilizes a specialized browser component that is native to the system it is running on. In the case of Windows, this component is the Microsoft Edge WebView2, which leverages the same technology that powers the Microsoft Edge browser.

Many users confuse it with the actual browser and mistakenly remove its files, which, unfortunately, breaks the Modrinth app. If you have made the same mistake, fear not — follow these simple steps to repair it:

1. To get started, download the [Microsoft Edge WebView2 installer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) and proceed with the installation.
2. If you encounter an ‘already installed’ message, try running the installer as administrator.
3. Once the installation is complete, give the Modrinth app another go.
