# The Modrinth Manual

The Modrinth Manual intends to provide a comprehensive guide on Modrinth and topics related to Modrinth, such as modded Minecraft, among other things.

It is intended for this guide to always be up-to-date and the source of truthful information about Modrinth. It is structured in a way resembling [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or any college/high-school textbook. Unlike a textbook, however, this is a living document, without specific versions or errata. If there is a change to be made, it will be made, by contributing to [the documentation repository on GitHub](https://github.com/modrinth/docs).

This manual's contents, having been published by Modrinth, are verified by Modrinth staff before publish. Oftentimes, it is also directly written by Modrinth staff.
