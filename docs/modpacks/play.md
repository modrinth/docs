# Playing Modpacks

A modpack is a list of mods bundled with additional files, such as configuration files. In general, it's a modded instance of a game ready to play.

**[The Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app)** is the official solution for playing Modrinth modpacks. You can install a Modrinth modpack using the app by clicking the "Browse" button on the left side of the launcher. Then, simply click "Install" on the modpacks you want to play.

Besides [the Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app), the easiest ways to play a Modrinth modpack are via [MultiMC](https://multimc.org), [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com), or [BakaXL](https://www.bakaxl.com/).

To install a modpack on the server-side, try [mrpack-install](https://github.com/nothub/mrpack-install) or [the `itzg/minecraft-server` image](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) if using Docker.

### MultiMC and Prism Launcher

Modrinth packs can be installed using the "Add instance" button and clicking "Modrinth" on the left. It's as easy as selecting the one you want, and pressing "OK".
