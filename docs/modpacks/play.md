# Playing Modpacks

A modpack is a list of mods bundled with additional files, such as configuration files. In general, it's a modded instance of a game ready to play.

**[The Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app)** is the official solution for playing Modrinth modpacks. You can install a Modrinth modpack using the app by clicking the "Browse" button on the left side of the launcher. Then, simply click "Install" on the modpacks you want to play.

Besides [the Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app), the easiest ways to play a Modrinth modpack are via [MultiMC](https://multimc.org), [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com), [BakaXL](https://www.bakaxl.com/), or [Superpack](https://github.com/Gaming32/Superpack/releases).

To install a modpack on the server-side, try [mrpack-install](https://github.com/nothub/mrpack-install) or [the `itzg/minecraft-server` image](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) if using Docker.
