# Playing Modpacks

A modpack is a list of mods bundled with additional files, such as configuration files. In general, it's a modded instance of a game ready to play, or with minor changes.

## How do I create a modpack?

Please see the guide for [creating modpacks](creating_modpacks.md).

## How do I play a modpack?

Currently, the stable way to play a Modrinth modpack is via [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com) or via [PolyMC](https://polymc.org). You can also install Modrinth packs if you switch to the development branch of [MultiMC](https://multimc.org).

### ATLauncher

ATLauncher is a launcher focused on easy integration of modpacks with various different platforms.

Modrinth packs can be installed using ATLauncher in as few as three clicks. Go to the "Packs" tab, select Modrinth on the left, and search for the pack you want. Then, play!

If you just want to insert an ID, slug, or URL directly, you can also do so using the "Add Manually" button by the top-right of the search

If you have a direct link to a Modrinth pack, you also have the option of importing it using the "Import" button in the "Instances" tab.

Modrinth packs are currently only available when using the development branch of MultiMC.

Then, close the settings and press Update to swap to the development branch.

Modrinth packs can be installed using the "Add instance" button and clicking "Modrinth (WIP)" on the left. It's as easy as selecting the one you want, and pressing "OK".

If you want to insert a URL directly, you can do so by selecting "Import from zip" instead of "Modrinth".

### PolyMC

PolyMC is a launcher forked from MultiMC, licensed under GPL. It allows playing Modrinth modpacks in its stable version.

Modrinth packs can be installed using the "Add instance" button and clicking "Modrinth" on the left. It's as easy as selecting the one you want, and pressing "OK".
