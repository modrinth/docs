# Modrinth Public Roadmap

Modrinth is always innovating and growing. These are some of the things that the Modrinth Team have already done, are working on, and plan to do. This roadmap is not in any particular order — one item will not be done right after the other.

- Create an open, robust, and [documented](/api-spec) API
- [Pay creators](https://modrinth.com/legal/cmp-info) who upload their projects to Modrinth
- Provide quality-of-life features like the gallery, dependencies, [Maven](maven.md), and more
- Allow creators to team up and manage permissions
- Roll out our own authentication service
- Create [a robust launcher](https://modrinth.com/app) integrated with Modrinth
