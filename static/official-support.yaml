      description: "For official support from Modrinth staff, head over to [support.modrinth.com](https://support.modrinth.com).
      Search for your issue, and file a support thread using the green button in the bottom right if none of the pages
      address your issue. We respond to all support threads within 24 hours. Modrinth staff are only able to assist with
      questions and issues regarding Modrinth itself, so we cannot help with game crashes. Otherwise, our team is here to
      assist you promptly!"
